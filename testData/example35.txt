    HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:   Accession 180001279
    
    CLINICAL NOTES:
    Right (illegible) ovarian  cystectomy  and  HD&C.   Right  ovarian  cyst  plus
    endometrial curettings.
    MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    (A) Right ovarian cyst:   A disrupted cyst measuring 45 x 30 x  20mm,  containing
    soft cream material, hair, haemorrhagic tissue, firm  grey  yellow  tissue,  and
    enlarged corpus luteum with a central brown content.  There are multiple  intact
    cysts filled with clear fluid identified. The cyst wall ranges in size from  1mm
    to 3mm, the external surface is smooth  and  shiny.    Representative  sections.
    A1-A2.
    Additional blocks.  Entire tissue submitted.  A3-A4.   Only  cyst  contents  not
    submitted.
    RM/RM.  22/1.
    (B) Endometrial curettings :  Multiple fragments of pale  tan  tissue,  measuring
    in aggregates,
    10 x 7 x 2mm.  All in.  B1.
    RM/RM.  20/1/2018.
    MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    (A)  The specimen has been submitted in its entirety. There is ovarian stroma in
    the cyst wall.  Most of the cyst lining is devoid of an epithelial lining and is
    lined instead by a diffuse florid foreign body giant cell reaction admixed  with
    histiocytes.  In areas the wall is quite fibrous.   A  small  amount  of  benign
    squamous epithelium (blocks A2, A4), benign glandular epithelium (block A1)  and
    bone is noted.  Some of the tissue also appears infarcted, and  shows  infarcted
    adipose tissue as well as what appears to be skin adnexal structures.  There  is
    also benign corpus luteum noted.  There are no immature neural elements.   There
    is no malignancy.
    The overall features are of a mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst).
    (B)  The uterine curettings have been submitted in their entirety.   This  shows
    interval endometrium. Less than  50%  of  the  glands  show  uniform  subnuclear
    vacuolation and there are  scattered  mitotic  figures.   There  is  no  chronic
    endometritis.  The overall gland to stroma ratio is preserved.  There is no
    cytological atypia, hyperplasia or malignancy.
    RM/RM 22/01/18
    
    DIAGNOSIS:
    (A) Right ovarian cyst:
    Mature cystic teratoma (dermoid cyst) with some areas of infarction, as well  as
    benign corpus luteum.
    (B)  Uterine curettings :
    Interval endometrium (suggestive but not diagnostic of POD1).

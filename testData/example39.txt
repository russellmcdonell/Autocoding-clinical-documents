tissue measuring 15x5x7mm and 23x20x7mm.
BLOCKS: 1, five transverse sections of the smaller fragment; 2&3, six
transverse sections of the larger fragment. Three blocks all submitted.

MICROSCOPIC REPORT:
1. LLETZ. Sections from the LLETZ biopsy of cervix, which has been entirely
examined at multiple deeper levels (cut-through), include the transformation
zone and show squamous metaplasia and moderate active chronic cervicitis. The
transformation zone is partly denuded. Foci of epithelial erosion with
underlying lymphoplasmacytic inflammation are also seen. There is no koilocytic
atypia and a squamous intraepithelial lesion is not seen. P16 immunostain is
negative. Some glands show tubal metaplasia. There is no glandular dysplasia or
malignancy.
2. Endometrial curettings. Sections show numerous endometrial fragments
scattered amongst blood and mucous. Histologically normal endocervical mucosal
fragments are also included. Within the endometrial fragments, small tubular
glands are seen. The glandular epithelium lacks proliferative or secretory
activity. There is no increase in the gland-to-stroma ratio. There is no
stromal atypia. There is no glandular dysplasia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
1. LLETZ
- SQUAMOUS METAPLASIA AND EPITHELIAL EROSIONS
- MODERATE ACTIVE CHRONIC CERVICITIS
2. ENDOMETRIAL CURETTINGS
- INACTIVE ENDOMETRIUM

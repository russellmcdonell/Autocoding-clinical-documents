HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
ACCESSION No. ZZ18-999967




CLINICAL HISTORY
CIN3. LLETZ. Endometrial curettings for histopathology.

MACROSCOPY
Pot labelled: LLETZ
Number of pieces: 1
Orientation marker: not orientated
Specimen measurements
- Diameter of ectocervix: 17 x 16 mm
- Length of specimen (if intact): 7 mm
- Length of canal (if intact): 3 mm
External os: identified, narrow and 4 mm
Macroscopically visible lesion: difficult to identify the mucosa
surface



Half of the possible margin inked green and other half black. Sliced
into 4 TS and AE in 2 blocks (2 in each).

2: Endometrial curettings: Few pieces of tan tissue and mucoid
material sent on surgical gauze measuring less than 0.5 mL in
aggregate. AE in one block.

MICROSCOPY
1. The entire specimen has been serially sliced and submitted for
histological examination. Each tissue block has been examined in
multiple levels. Sections demonstrate cervical transformation zone and
a length of endocervical canal. Transformation zone mucosa is largely
denuded. Where present, the epithelium is mainly limited to the basal
two thirds with most of the surface epithelium denuded. There are
areas with features of moderate squamous dysplasia, consistent with
CIN 2, with extensive involvement of the underlying endocervical
glands. There are changes of human papilloma virus infection. The
endocervical epithelium is otherwise unremarkable. No primary
glandular abnormality is noted. The cervical stroma is moderately
inflamed. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy. The dysplasia
focally extends to the cauterized resection margin.


2. Sections show large amounts of mucus, admixed with a few fragments
of proliferative endometrium. The endometrial glands are simple, lined
by columnar epithelium, showing scattered mitoses. The endometrial
stroma is unremarkable. Some fragmented endocervical tissue is also
present. There is no evidence of endometritis, endometrial polyp,
hyperplasia or malignancy.

CONCLUSION
1. LLETZ BIOPSY: Moderate squamous dysplasia (CIN 2) and features of
human papilloma virus infection.


2. ENDOMETRIAL CURETTINGS: Small amounts of proliferative endometrium.

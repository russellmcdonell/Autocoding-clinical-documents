ACCESSION No. ZZ18-999915




CLINICAL HISTORY
HSIL. Stitch on cx@12 o'clock. Cervix cone biopsy. Endocervical
curettings.

MACROSCOPY
1. Cervix - cone biopsy, stitch 12 o'clock:A oriented LLETZ biopsy, 15
x 10 mm, 10 mm in depth, oriented with a suture at one end designated
12 o'clock. The surface is smooth and tan with a slitlike os, 10 mm
in diameter (the os runs from 12 to 6 o'clock). Margins inked 3
o'clock blue, 9 o'clock black. The canal length is 8 mm. Please refer
to attached diagram.

1A - 1D: Serial 6 TS, submitted from 12 to 6 o'clock (note: 1B and 1C
to contain one TS each, fragmented into two pieces)

2. Cervical curettings: Multiple fragments of tan haemorrhagic tissue
and mucus, 15 x 7 mm. All submitted in one cassette.

MICROSCOPY
1. Sections, examined at 3 levels, identify squamous and glandular
mucosa showing squamous metaplasia. There is focal mucosal erosion.
The stroma shows mild-to-moderate infiltrate of lymphocytes and plasma
cells. No evidence of human papilloma virus infection, dysplasia or
malignancy is seen. The glandular component is unremarkable.

2. The section shows tiny strips of squamous and glandular epithelium
showing mild chronic inflammation, admixed with mucus. No evidence of
dysplasia or malignancy is seen.

CONCLUSION
1. Oriented cone biopsy of cervix: Focal erosion. Squamous metaplasia.

2. Cervical curettings: Small amount of inflamed cervical mucosa with
no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.

* NOTE: Additional deeper levels are in progress and a supplementary
report will be issued.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT
Specimen 1. Additional deeper levels (x11) show mucosal erosion and
squamous metaplasia with no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. There
is negative immunostaining for p16 in squamous and metaplastic
epithelium (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D).

The initial conclusion remains unchanged.

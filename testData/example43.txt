HISTOLOGY REPORT
----------------
SPECIMEN NUMBER: 2018A000359

SITE: CERVICAL BIOPSY.

CLINICAL NOTES:
LLETZ 2015 - CIN 3. F/U abnormal colp. Cervical biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
(Cervical biopsy).
The specimen consists of a single pale tan piece of tissue measuring
6 x 4 x 2mm. (RM:rm)

MICROSCOPIC:
RCPA structured  reporting for  excisions and  colposcopic biopsies
for pre-invasive cervical neoplasia

Microscopic description: The  specimen has been examined at multiple
levels.  The  sections  show  a single  cervical   biopsy,  there is
moderate loss of epithelium  present.  The  biopsy shows involvement
by  low-grade   squamous     intraepithelial   lesion   (CIN  1) and
koilocytosis  in keeping  with  HPV effect.   Focally,  the squamous
cells  are  disorganised,  the  nuclei  are  slightly  enlarged  and
irregular.    These  changes  are  limited  to  the  lower  third of
epithelium.     There  is  no  high-grade   dysplasia  or   invasive
malignancy.   There is  moderate active  chronic  cervicitis and the
epithelium  focally  shows reactive  changes  and immature  squamous
metaplasia.  There is no glandular atypia.

Tissues  present:  Ectocervical  mucosa,  metaplastic  endocervical
mucosa and underlying stroma.

SCJ included in specimen: Yes.

High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion: Not present.

AIS: Not present.

Stratified Mucin-producing Intraepithelial Lesion (SMILE): Not seen.

Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion: Present (CIN1).

Other pathology:  Moderate  active chronic  cervicitis  and immature
squamous metaplasia.

Ancillary studies
      HR HPV (not 16/18): Detected.
      P16: Not performed.

DIAGNOSIS:
Cervical biopsy: LOW-GRADE  SQUAMOUS  INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION (CIN 1)
AND KOILOCYTOSIS IN KEEPING WITH HPV EFFECT. (RM:rm)

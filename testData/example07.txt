HISTOPATHOLOGY

REF: 2018/1486
AMENDED REPORT: MICROSCOPY TO DESCRIBE THE MYOMETRIAL CHANGES HAS BEEN
AMENDED.
CLINICAL HISTORY
Complex atypical hyperplasia.

MACROSCOPY
Uterus, tubes and ovaries:  A uterus received sagittally opened with
bilaterally attached fallopian tubes weighing 97g.  The right fallopian
tube measures 55 x 7mm and the right ovary measures 25 x 10 x 15mm.  The
left fallopian tube measures 60 x 7mm and the left ovary measures 30 x
15 x 14mm.  The uterus itself measures 40mm AP, 50mm in bicornuate
diameter and 70mm cervix to fundus.  The ectocervix is unremarkable, 30
x 35mm with a central slit-like os measuring up to 12mm.  The uterine
cervix is unremarkable.  The endometrium is &lt;2mm in thickness and the
myometrium is up to 18mm in thickness.  There is a submucosal nodule at
the fundus measuring up to 18mm in maximum diameter.  There is a further
intramyometrial white pale, well circumscribed and whorled nodule
measuring up to 5mm.  The submucosal nodule has the same cut surface
(whorled/pale/homogenous).
Blocks:  1A - right fallopian tube plus fimbria; 1B - right ovary; 1C -
left fallopian tube plus fimbria; 1D - left ovary; 1E and 1F - right
cervix to LUS; 1G and 1H - left cervix to LUS; 1I to 1Z - entire
endomyometrium; AA - submucosal nodule.  Reserve tissue remain.  (RM/rm)

MICROSCOPY
Cervix:
- There is no evidence of squamous or glandular dysplasia.
- Sections from the lower segment show tubal metaplasia (slide (block H)
reviewed by Dr Russell McDonell)

Endometrium:
- Predominantly proliferative endometrium. Very focally there is an
apparently detached residual polypoid area containing a few atypical
endometrial glands. There is no evidence of malignancy.

Myometrium:
- The submucosal and myometrial nodules are leiomyomas with typical
histologic appearances.

Fallopian tubes:
- The right fallopian tube exhibits benign paratubal, including fimbria
l, cysts. The fallopian tube is otherwise within normal limits.

Ovaries:
- There are scattered surface adhesions associated with mesothelial
hyperplasia, fibrin and haemosiderin deposition. The ovaries are
otherwise within normal limits.

SUMMARY DIAGNOSIS
UTERUS, TUBES AND OVARIES:
-FOCAL ATYPICAL ENDOMETRIAL HYPERPLASIA
-PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM
-BENIGN LEIOMYOMAS
-NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

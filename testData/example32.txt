SPECIMEN:
LLETZ.

CLINICAL:
LLETZ biopsy; CIN2; Rx Depo-Provera

MACROSCOPIC:
An unorientated fragment of mucosa 15 x 11mm, with underlying tissue to a depth
of 9mm bearing a central os, 5mm in width.  The specimen is cut into 8TS.
(11p/8b/nr)
BLOCK KEY:
1-4:one slice, one piece each, 5-7:one slice, two pieces, containing the os,
8:one slice, one piece.

MICROSCOPIC:
The entire LLETZ specimen has been sectioned and embedded into 8 blocks and
shows representation of the transformation zone.  Two out of the eight blocks
show a high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), equivalent to CIN2.
This is characterised by squamous cells having enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei
with an elevated nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, involving the lower two thirds of
the squamous epithelium.  An occasional mitotic figure is seen extending to the
mid-epithelial layers.  CIN2 spans a length of 0.9mm along the canal and
involves the ectocervical margin.  It is well-clear of the endocervical and
radial margins and does not involve the peripheral slices of the specimen.
Patchy active chronic inflammation and foci of immature squamous metaplasia are
also present.  There is no invasive malignancy or endocervical glandular atypia.

CONCLUSION:
LLETZ:  HSIL, equivalent to CIN2.
- Present in 2 of 8 blocks.
- Extending to the ectocervical margin.
- Endocervical and radial margins clear.

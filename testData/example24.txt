HISTORY
LLETZ for CIN2 on biopsy.  Nil obvious aceto white at time of op.  
MACROSCOPIC
Russell McDonell, Large loop excision transformation zone:  Two irregular pieces of LLETZ specimen, the smallest one measuring 8x7x3 mm.  The second piece measures 12x7x3 mm.  The mucosal surface is unremarkable.  The deep margin is inked blue.  The specimen is serially sectioned and blocked entirely.  1A ends ink face down from the larger portion; 1B 3 TS of  the larger portion; 1C ink face down of ends of the smaller portion; 1D 2 TS of the smaller portion. (R McDonell/ram6)
MICROSCOPIC
Large loop excision transformation zone:  Sections of the LLETZ biopsy include transformation zone. There are focal changes of a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 2) involving the smaller fragment (1C & 1D), extending to the inked resection margin in this fragment. There is no evidence of glandular dysplasia or invasive malignancy.
SUMMARY
Large loop excision transformation zone:  Focal high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 2).

HISTORY
LLETZ      ?CIN 2/3.
MACROSCOPIC
Russell McDonell, LLETZ:   An intact unoriented  LLETZ excision measuring 20x15x17 mm.  The cervical os is 12 mm.  The ectocervix is tan and roughened and is partially absent on one side of the cervical os.  The excision is inked endocervical margin green and remainder of resection margin half blue and half black.   1A End ink side down; 1B-1E 1TS per block; 1F Ink side down (note 1C-1E fragmented on sectioning).   (Dr R McDonell / ram2)
MICROSCOPIC
LLETZ: The cervical LLETZ cone biopsy is sited on the transformation zone. There is extensive loss of surface epithelium in the tissue sections.High and low grade CIN is present in detached fragments of surface epithelium and very focal high grade CIN  is present in the scant retained under lying crypt metaplastic squamous epithelium. There is no glandular atypia or invasive disease present.The high grade dysplasia appears to have been completely excised with retained normal surface epithelium present at both the endo and ectocervical surgical margins.
SUMMARY
LLETZ:  High grade CIN2-3.

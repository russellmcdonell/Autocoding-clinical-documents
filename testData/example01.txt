    HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:   Accession 180001119
    
    CLINICAL NOTES:
    Past history breast Ca. Never had Tamoxifen.
    ET 11mm on pelvic ultrasound. Menorrhagia and adenomyosis.
    1. Endometrial curettings and polyp. 2. Left mons cyst. 3. Left labial cyst.
    MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    (A) Endometrial  curettings:   Multiple  fragments  of  pale  tan  and  congested
    tissue in aggregate measuring 27 x 18 x 3mm. There is also an ovoid,  firm  pale
    tan partially congested piece of tissue measuring 30 x 12 x 5mm. All in. A1-A2.
    A1: multiple fragments. A2: large pale tan tissue sliced into eight pieces.
    (B) Left Mons cyst : An irregular,  firm  roughened  pale  tan  piece  of  tissue
    measuring 10 x 8 x 4mm. Specimen is trisected. All in. B1.
    (C) Left labial cyst : An irregular,  firm  pale  tan  wrinkly  piece  of  tissue
    measuring 15 x 7 x 4mm. A cystic structure  is  not  identifiable.  Specimen  is
    sliced into four pieces. All in. C1.\
    RM/RM 18.1.18
    MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    (A) Endometrial curettings : The curettage  fragments  include  a  lot  of  blood
    with some benign shedding endometrial tissue.  Severa;  broad  (10mm)  fragments
    suggests a benign endometrial polyp, with mildly disordered  weak  proliferative
    glands  showing  some  ciliated  metaplasia,  and  fibro-muscular  stroma   with
    thickened blood vessels.
    There is no evidence of chronic endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy .
    (B) Left Mons cyst : A benign keratocyst with  hyperplastic  stratified  squamous
    epithelium including a granular layer. There is no dysplasia or malignancy.
    (C) Left labial cyst : Dense fibrous  stroma  and  benign  hyperplastic  squamous
    epithelium.
    The squamous epithelium appears the be  surface  epithelium,  and  there  is  no
    obvious cystic space.
    (RM) 19/1/2018.
    DIAGNOSIS:
    (A) ENDOMETRIAL CURETTINGS :
    MILDLY DISORDERED WEAK PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM
    + APPEARANCES SUGGESTING A BENIGN POLYP
    + FOCAL SHEDDING.
    (B) LEFT MONS CYST :
    BENIGN KERATOCYST.
    (C) LEFT LABIAL CYST :
    FIBRO-EPITHELIAL POLYP.

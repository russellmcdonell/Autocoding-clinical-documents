    HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:   Accession 180001043
    
    CLINICAL NOTES:
    CIN2/3 Pap.  CIN2 on biopsy.  LLETZ.
    MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    (A) LLETZ cervix,  stitch  anterior:    An  orientated  cone  biopsy  of  cervix,
    orientation as above, measuring 22mm from anterior to posterior, 18mm from right
    lateral to left lateral and with underlying tissue  to  a  depth  of  6mm.   The
    ectocervical mucosa on the posterior aspect is absent.  The ectocervical  mucosa
    on the anterior aspect is smooth,  grey  and  shiny.   The  ectocervical  os  is
    slit-like, measuring 10 x 1mm and centrally located.
    The specimen is serially sliced into five transverse sections from left  lateral
    to right lateral.  The cut surface reveals focally congested grey  tissue,  with
    multiple cystic spaces up to 2mm in  dimension.
    An additional two pieces of tissue with mucosa attached, measuring 18 x 3 x  6mm
    and 8 x 2 x 2mm are also present.
    Specimen inking: anterior margin inked blue and posterior margin inked black.
    The larger of the two additional pieces is serially sliced into  six  transverse
    sections, and the resection surface is inked with blue dye.
    All in.  A1-A6.  A1-A5: main specimen submitted left lateral to  right  lateral.
    A6: additional pieces.
    RM/RM.  18/1/2018.
    MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    The cervical biopsy includes  the  transformation  zone  where  the  metaplastic
    squamous epithelium shows wart virus related changes. There is loss  of  nuclear
    polarity and mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism involving the lower third  of
    the metaplastic epithelium. Suprabasal mitotic figures are present ( A2, A3).
    These features represent a low grade squamous  intraepithelial  lesion  (CIN  I)
    with HPV related changes. The endocervical glands included show no  evidence  of
    glandular dysplasia. There is no  invasive  tumour.  The  margins  are  clear  (
    clearance of more than 4mm).
    RM. 22/1/18
    DIAGNOSIS:
    
    (A) LLETZ cervix, stitch anterior:
    Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN I) with HPV related changes.
    Margin clear.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
Reporting Pathologist: Dr. R. McDonell
CLINICAL NOTES:
1 Cone cervix, suture 12 o&#39;clock.
2 Endometrial curettings.
3 Endocervical curettings.
Susp ACIS on punch biopsies of cervix.
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: CR
1 Specimen labelled `Cones biopsy, stic at 12 o&#39;clock&#39;: The specimen consists
of an orientated ring of grey mucosa measuring 25 x 23mm to a depth of 12mm.
There is a single orientating suture designated 12 o&#39;clock. No macroscopic
lesion can be identified. The specimen is inked 3 o&#39;clock blue, 9 o&#39;clock red.
The specimen has been sectioned from 12 o&#39;clock to 6 o&#39;clock into eleven
slices.
Blocks 1 to 5 each contain two slices; block 6 single slice. T11 six blocks all
in.
2 Specimen labelled `Endometrial curette&#39;: The specimen consists of grey tissue
admixed with blood clot measuring in aggregate 15 x 10 x 5mm. T multiple one
block all in.
3 Specimen labelled `Cervical curette&#39;: The specimen consists of multiple
fragments of grey tissue and blood clot admixed with mucus measuring in
aggregate 15 x 10 x 5mm. T multiple one block all in.
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
1 Sections show a tiny focus of residual high grade squamous intraepithelial
lesion (CIN II and HPV infection) and adenocarcinoma in-situ close to the
transformation zone. No stromal invasion is found. Excision appearscomplete.
2 Sections show proliferative endometrium with a normalgland to stroma ratio.
There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or malignancy.
3 Sections show similar normalproliferative endometrium mixed with inspissated
mucinous material. There is no evidence of endometritis, hyperplasia or
malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
1 CONE BIOPSY CERVIX:
- FOCAL CIN II, HPV INFECTION AND AIS, COMPLETELY EXCISED.
2 & 3 ENDOMETRIAL AND CERVICAL CURETTINGS:
- NORMAL PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM.

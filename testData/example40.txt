CLINICAL HISTORY
Perianal warts. CIN-3 in Colp/Bx. LLETZ done.

MACROSCOPY
1) &quot;Cervical specimen&quot; - An excisional biopsy of cervix 25 x 18 x 18mm
with smooth glistening ectocervix. Inking: Surgical margins blue. All
processed. 3 blocks.
1A - both ends.
1B-2, 1C-1 - serial sequential sections through specimen.
2) &quot;Perianal warts&quot; - Twenty two fragmented pieces of polypoid tissue in
aggregate 60 x 55 x 15mm. The largest piece 22 x 25 x 15mm. All
processed. 7 blocks.
2A-9, 2B-9, 2C-2, 2D-6, 2E-5, 2F-4, 2G-7. ec

MICROSCOPY
1) &quot;Cervical specimen&quot; - Sections examined at multiple levels show
cervical mucosa including metaplastic squamous epithelium from the
transformation zone with an area of high-grade dysplasia, mitotic
figures seen at all levels of the epithelium. Dysplastic epithelium
extends into endocervical glands but no microinvasive malignancy is
identified. There is also mild active chronic cervicitis and
endocervicitis, some inflammatory changes associated with the previous
biopsy site. There is also evidence of koilocytotic atypia.

2) &quot;Perianal warts&quot; -Sections examined at multiple levels show polypoid
pieces of skin with evidence of irritation and squamous acanthosis.
Keratinocytes with prominent keratohyaline granules and also viral
effect including cytoplasmic vacuolation in areas are identified. In 2
of the larger polyps there is koilocytotic atypia with mitotic figures
seen in the lower half of the epidermis in one polyp. No unequivocal
full thickness dysplasia is seen and no invasive malignancy is
identified.

SUMMARY DIAGNOSIS
1) CERVICAL SPECIMEN:
      -HIGH GRADE SEVERE SQUAMOUS DYSPLASIA (CIN 3). THE HIGH GRADE
DYSPLASIA INVOLVES THE BLUE INKED ENDOCERVICAL MARGIN (BLOCK DESIGNATED
1B) BUT IS CLEAR OF THE ECTOCERVICAL MARGIN BY AT LEAST 6.0 MM.


2) PERIANAL WARTS:
      -PERIANAL WARTS (VERRUCA) IS CONFIRMED.
AIN-2 (MODERATE SQUAMOUS DYSPLASIA) IN 1 WART (PLEASE SEE MICROSCOPIC).

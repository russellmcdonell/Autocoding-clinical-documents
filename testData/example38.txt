HISTORY
Difficult colp. 2 x pass LLETZ. Colp imp: low grade, but HPV 16+ and CIN2-3 bx.
MACROSCOPIC
Russell McDonell, Large loop excision of the transformation zone:  Three fragments of crotaline tissue measuring 16x12x6 mm, 12x5x5 mm and 5x3x3 mm. The os can be recognised on one fragment.  The resection margins are inked blue peripherally and orange were the os is identified. 1A largest fragment, 1TS each end ink face down; 1B 2TS; 1C 1TS; 1D second fragment 4TS; 1E third fragment. Submitted in toto. (Dr R McDonell/rm1)
MICROSCOPIC
Sections of cervical transformation zone show a high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 3).  There is no evidence of invasion.  The glandular epithelium is unremarkable.  The dysplasia extends to one endocervicalmargin.
SUMMARY
Large loop excision of the transformation zone: High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (CIN 3), at an endocervical margin.

CLINICAL HISTORY
CIN 2 on curettings.  LLETZ.

MACROSCOPY
LLETZ, stitch@12 o'clock: A LLETZ specimen 25 x 10 x 6 mm (length x
width x height), received with a slightly disrupted 9 o'clock edge,
with an ectocervical face bearing pale red excoriation covering an 18
x 10 mm area abutting the 6 o'clock margin.  There is no appreciable
os.   There is also a separate ragged cervical fragment, 10 mm. There
is a stitch on one long edge indicating 12 o'clock. 12 o'clock inked
blue. 6 o'clock inked black. Serially sliced. A: 3 o'clock end piece
with separate ragged fragment, B-C: Central slices, D: 9 o'clock end
piece. A4

MICROSCOPY
There is a LLETZ biopsy of cervix sampling nonkeratinising
ectocervical squamous epithelium, transformation zone, endocervical
mucinous glandular mucosa and underlying moderately chronically
inflamed cervical stroma. The transformation zone is involved by mild
squamous dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1, CIN 1)
comprising partial thickness keratinocyte atypia, but with maturation
towards the surface and there is also concurrent koilocytosis
consistent with human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. This area is
also involved by active neutrophilic inflammation. There is no high-
grade dysplasia or invasion. The endocervical mucinous glandular
component bears a few nabothian cysts which are filled with mucin
which sometimes contains degenerate acute inflammation.
Immunohistochemistry for p16 and Ki-67 has been utilised on Block B
and shows no evidence of high-grade high-grade squamous
intraepithelial lesion. Blocks B and C have been examined with a total
of 9 levels and reveal no high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.
 CIN 1 and HPV-related changes are 2mm from the 6 o'clock
endocervical margin and 3mm from the 12 o'clock ectocervical margin.

CONCLUSION
LLETZ:  CIN 1 and HPV-related changes.

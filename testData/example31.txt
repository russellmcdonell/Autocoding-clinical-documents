SPECIMEN:
Curettings and polyp.

CLINICAL:
Curettings and polypectomy.

MACROSCOPIC:
Multiple grey, soft friable fragments of tissue measuring in aggregate, 15 x 10
x 2mm.  (mp/1b/nr)

MICROSCOPIC:
All the tissue has been processed and examined histologically.  Sections show a
fragment of endometrium as well as multiple fragments of endocervical, lower
uterine segment and ectocervical tissue.  The endometrium comprises of glands of
varying shapes and sizes, with some which are tubular to others which are more
dilated and irregular with ciliated cell change.  A couple of prominent spiral
arterioles are noted.  The stroma varies from the usual endometrial type stroma
to fragments with fibrous stroma.  At the end of one of the fibrous fragments, a
small amount of endocervical type epithelium is noted.  No cytological atypia
seen.

The other fragments of ectocervical and endocervical tissue are unremarkable.
No HPV effect.

CONCLUSION:
Curettings and polypectomy:  Benign endometrium with features in keeping with a
polyp and portions of benign ectocervical and endocervical tissue.

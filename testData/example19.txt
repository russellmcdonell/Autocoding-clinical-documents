ACCESSION No. ZZ18-999913




CLINICAL HISTORY
Ectopic pregnancy. 1. Ectopic R fallopian tube. 2. Curettings. 3. HVS
+ chlamydia/gonorrhoea PCR + copper IUD MCS.

MACROSCOPY
1. R fallopian tube ectopic: A right fallopian tube, 53 x 10 mm, with
a fimbriated end. The external surface is smooth and tan with a full
thickness defect identified, 20 mm in greatest dimension. The cut
surface is pale tan with focal haemorrhagic areas. All tissue is
submitted in four cassettes.

2. Curettings: Multiple fragments of pale tan soft tissue, 15 x 10 mm
in aggregate. All submitted in one cassette.

MICROSCOPY
1. Sections from fallopian tube identify small numbers of
intermediate-type trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts  within the
fallopian tube wall. No chorionic villous is identified. The serosal
surface shows focal reactive hyperplasia and associated mild active on
chronic inflammation. There is no evidence of malignancy.

2. The section shows small amount of endometrial tissue, composed of
tubular to torturous glands, lined by low columnar epithelium with no
mitotic activity identified. The majority of glands shows cytoplasmic
vacuoles. There is diffuse stromal decidualisation. Some pieces appear
polypoid with slightly fibrotic stroma containing medium-size
vessels. The stroma contains scattered lymphocytes, plasma cells and
neutrophils. No evidence of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy is
seen.

CONCLUSION
1. Right fallopian tube: Features consistent with ectopic (tubal)
pregnancy.

2. Uterine curettings: Secretory endometrium with some changes raising
the possibility of endometrial polyp(s). Focal active on chronic
endometritis.

* NOTE: Confirmatory immunohistochemical staining on specimen 1 is in
progress and a supplementary report will be issued.

Immunohistochemical staining (1A) - Implantation-site, intermediate
type trophoblasts stain with HCG and hPL.

The original conclusion remains unchanged.

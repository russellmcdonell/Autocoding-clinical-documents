REF: 2018/1131/zu/ml                            18/01/2018
CLINICAL HISTORY
Fibroid - transminal anterior fundal, subfertility. Endometriosis.

MACROSCOPY
1) &amp;quot;McDonell. Uterine fibroid&amp;quot; - Pale fibroid 35x25x25mm, covered in
brown friable tissue. Fibroid has a uniform pale coiled cut surface.
A1x1, 1Bx1, 1Cx1, 1Dx1. 4RS TS.
2) &amp;quot;McDonell. Endometrial biopsy&amp;quot; - Cream brown tissues in aggregate
20x20x4mm. 2xM. All in.
3) &amp;quot;McDonell. Left uterosacral&amp;quot; - Tan fragment 12x7x5mm. Bisected. All
in. 3x2.
4) &amp;quot;McDonell. Pouch of Douglas&amp;quot; - Two tan fragments 15x12x10mm,
13x10x5mm. Both bisected. All in. 4x4.
5) &amp;quot;McDonell. Right uterosacral peritoneum&amp;quot; - Tan tissue 20x15x8mm.
TS. 5x4. All in. (rm)

MICROSCOPY
1) Representative sections show a neoplasm composed of cuboidal to flat
cells forming cords that are epithelial like and channels with dilated
lumina simulating vessels. The cells show scanty eosinophilic cytoplasm
and the nuclei are bland, and show no mitoses or necrosis. The
intervening stroma shows bundles of bland smooth muscle cells. A panel
of immunohistochemistry has been performed.  The cells forming cords and
channels show strong positive immunolabelling for Calretinin.
Immunihistochemistry for WT1 shows a weak positive immunolabelling.
Immunistains for Ber EP 4 and CEA are negative.  CD 31 and CD34
highlight blood vessels within the lesion but not the dilated spaces.
The morphology and the immunoprofile are compatible with an adenomatoid
tumour. There is no evidence of malignancy.

2) The sections show portions of secretory phase endometrium. There is
no evidence of chronic endometritis, endometrial hyperplasia or atypia.

3-5) All biopsies show similar features therefore are described
together. The sections show portions of fibroadipose connective tissue
incorporating foci of endometriosis. There is no evidence of malignancy.

SUMMARY DIAGNOSIS
1) Uterine fibroid:
- An adenomatoid tumour.

2) Endometrial biopsy:
- Secretory phase endometrium.

3-5) Biopsies as labelled:
- Endometriosis.

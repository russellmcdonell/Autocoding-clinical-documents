HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
ACCESSION No. Z18-999803

Clinical Notes:
Uterine prolapse.

Macroscopic Description:
Pot 1:Uterus: A uterus 93 x 44 x 36 mm and weighing 36 g. The
ectocervix is covered in a smooth pale tan distorted mucosa and
measures 22 x 15 mm. The endometrium has a smooth pale appearance with
a maximum thickness of 0.5 mm. The myometrium has a pale tan
appearance with a maximum thickness of 18 mm. Cut surface of the
anterior myometrium reveals a firm pale 8 mm nodule. (A - C
representative sections of anterior cervix, endometrium, myometrium
and nodule, D - F representative sections of posterior cervix,
endometrium and myometrium, pd).

Microscopic Description:
Sections show cervix, endometrium and myometrium. The cervix shows
ectocervix and endocervix with no HPV effect, dysplasia or malignancy
and no glandular abnormalities. The endometrium shows atrophic
features with scattered tubular and cystic glands lined by inactive
columnar epithelium set in a fibrous stroma. There is no plasma cell
infiltrate, atypical hyperplasia or evidence of malignancy. There is a
benign leiomyoma composed of a whorled arrangement of bland smooth
muscle cells. The fallopian tubes are lined by bland ciliated tubal
epithelium. There is no malignancy.

Conclusion:
Uterus: BENIGN;
- Benign cervix.
- Benign atrophic endometrium.
- Benign leiomyoma.

Pathologist: Dr Russell McDonell

Supplementary:
Reason for supplementary report: Alteration of the microscopic. The
conclusion remains unchanged.

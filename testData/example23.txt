CLINICAL HISTORY

LLETZ cx bx.  Histo please.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

One specimen is received labelled &quot;Russell McDonell; LLETZ BIOPSY CERVIX&quot; 
and consists of an unorientated LLETZ specimen measuring 20 x 15 x 
15mm.  The mucosal surface is smooth and tan.  No focal lesions are 
identified.  Specimen inked blue and serially transverse sectioned from 
one to the other.  

Block key: 1A - 1TS to one end; 1B - 2TS; 1C - 1TS; 1D - 1TS; 1E - 1TS; 
1F - 1TS other end.  1A and 1F ink side down.  Specimen submitted 
entirely.

Prosector: Dr Russell McDonell/rm


MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION

The excision includes transformation zone and the sections show severe 
dysplasia (CIN 3) with foci suspicious for imminent invasion. The CIN 
extends into underlying endocervical glands but there is no endocervical 
glandular dysplasia and no evidence of unequivocal invasive neoplasia. The 
CIN appears well clear of resection margins.

DIAGNOSIS

LLETZ BIOPSY OF CERVIX - HIGH GRADE SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION 
                          (CIN 3), MARGINS CLEAR

SPECIMEN TYPE: Tissue
REPORT NAME: HISTOPATHOLOGY
REPORTING PATHOLOGIST: Dr Russell McDonell
CLINICAL NOTES
Uterine prolapse.
MACROSCOPIC:
`Uterus'. A bivalved uterus, 75mm superior-inferior, 30mm intercornual, and
24mm anterior/posterior, weighing 21g. The ectocervix is 25 x 20 x 3mm and
appears thickened. The myometrium is 12mm. The endometrium is 1mm thick. No
focal lesions seen. Representative sections embedded.
Block 1: anterior ectocervix and lower uterus Block 2: anterior upper uterus
Block 3: posterior ectocervix and lower uterus
Block 4: posterior upper uterus
Block 5: further representative endometrium
Blocks 6-10: Remaining cervix all embedded Block 11: ? residual endometrium
rm/RM/RM
MICROSCOPIC:
The ectocervix shows areas of atrophy as well as areas of acanthosis and
parakeratosis, in keeping with prolapse. Focally surface koliocytic change is
seen in the ectocervix which is in keeping with Human papilloma virus
infection. There is no dysplasia or malignancy. P16 immunohistochemistry
shows patchy staining (negative for integrated high-risk HPV DNA).
The endometrium is inactive/weakly proliferative in most areas. However, there
are a few foci with increased gland to stroma ratio with very focal gland
architecture complexity which denotes involuting simple (with very focal
complex) hyperplasia. There is no active proliferative activity. Some patchy
ciliated cell metaplasia is also seen. The entire endometrium is embedded ad
there is no evidence of malignancy. Areas of adenomyosis and a small benign
submucosal leiomyoma are also present. There is no endometritis, atypia or
malignancy.
SUMMARY:
Uterus:
- Features in keeping with prolapse.
- Focal ectocervical koilocytosis consistent with Human papilloma virus
infection.
- Weakly proliferative/inactive endometrium with areas showing features of
involuting hyperplasia (mainly simple with very focal complex hyperplasia) -
Adenomyosis.
- Submucosal leiomyoma

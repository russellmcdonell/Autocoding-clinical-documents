MICROSCOPY:
Sections of the cervix show patchy cervicitis with mild reactive atypia of the
epithelium. The endometrium is decidualised with inactive widely spaced glands,
consistent with a Mirena. The myometrium shows patchy adenomyosis. The
myometrial nodule is a small benign leiomyoma. The serosal surface of the
uterus shows focal fresh haemorrhage in a fibrotic area. The right ovary is
unremarkable. The left ovary contains follicular cysts and multiple small foci
of endometriosis including in an area of surface fibrosis. There is also patchy
endometriosis on the surface of the fallopian tubes. There is no evidence of
atypia or malignancy.
DIAGNOSIS:
UTERUS, CERVIX, TUBES AND OVARIES
- ADENOMYOSIS
- ENDOMETRIOSIS
- CERVICITIS

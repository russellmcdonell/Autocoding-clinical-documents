CLINICAL HISTORY
Uterine fibroids.

MACROSCOPY
Uterus and tubes:  A uterus with bilaterally detached fallopian tubes.
Arbitrarily designated tube A measures 50 x 10mm with a tethered
paratubal cyst measuring up to 15mm (clear serous fluid).  Fallopian
tube B measures 65 x 6mm with a tethered parafimbrial cyst measuring 8mm
containing clear serous fluid.  The uterus weighs 966g and measures 80mm
bicornuate diameter, 150mm anterior to posterior and 175mm cervix to
fundus.  The ectocervix is unremarkable, 35 x 34mm with a central
slit-like os measuring up to 13mm.  The endometrium is less than 2mm in
thickness and the myometrium (uninvolved by fibroids) is up to 25mm.
The uterine serosa has nodules pushing through (likely subserosal
fibroids).  Sectioning reveals multiple intramyometrial (likely fibroids
- whorled/pale/homogenous) masses ranging between 5-80mm at maximal
dimension.  One mass has a darker/softer cut surface (measuring 38mm).
The fallopian tubes are unremarkable on sectioning.

Block key:  A & B - cervix to LUS; C & D - further cervix to LUS; E & F
- endomyometrium; G to J - composite slices of largest ?fibroid; K to N
- representative sections softer/darker mass; O - smallest ?fibroid; P -
fimbria A; Q - fallopian tube A + cyst; R - fimbria B; S - fallopian
tube B + cyst.  (RM/rm)

MICROSCOPY
Cervix:
- Sections of the cervix show no evidence of squamous or glandular
dysplasia.

Endometrium:
- Abnormal secretory endometrium characterised by tortuous glands which
are variably vacuolated and show extensive ciliated cell metaplasia.

Myometrium:
- The fibroids include a neurilemmoma-like leiomyoma with the darker,
softer lesion showing extensive infarct-type necrosis with dystrophic
calcification.

Fallopian tubes:
- Benign fimbrial cysts involving otherwise normal fallopian tubes.

Comment: Possible causes of abnormal secretory endometrium include
organic lesions such as submucosal leiomyomas together with progestin
effect, luteal phase defect and persistent corpus luteum (irregular
shedding).


SUMMARY DIAGNOSIS
Uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes:
-ABNORMAL SECRETORY ENDOMETRIUM (see Comment)
-BENIGN LEIOMYOMAS
-NO EVIDENCE OF MALIGNANCY.

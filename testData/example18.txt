HISTORY
LLETZ for histology. Colposcopy biopsy. 7 o&#39;clock CIN 1, 1 o&#39;clock CIN II. 
MACROSCOPIC
Russell McDonell HOWARD, LLETZ:  An unorientated LLETZ biopsy of cervix measuring 18x17 mm to a depth of 12 mm. The cervical os measures 4 mm in width. The ectocervical mucosa is smooth and tan. The endocervical margin is inked green, half the stromal margin blue and the other half black. Specimen is serially sectioned into 8 transverse slices and entirely submitted. 1A shave of one end inked side down; 1B-1E serial TS (1B 2TS, 1C&1D 1TS per block, 1E 2TS); 1F shave other end inked side down. (Dr R McDonell/rm9)
MICROSCOPIC 
The sections show cervical tissue including the transformation zone displaying low grade and focal marginal high grade intraepithelial squamous dysplasia (CIN 2) and koilocytosis. No glandular abnormality is identified. The lesion is clear of all resection margins. There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.
SUMMARY
LLETZ:  CIN 2; clear of excision margins.

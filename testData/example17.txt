HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
Reporting Pathologist: Dr. R. McDonell
Specimen received in laboratory: 17.1.18 at 1447 hours
CLINICAL NOTES:
Cervical polyp. Histopathology - polyps and curettings.
MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
Specimen labelled polyps and curettings. Specimen consists of multiple
fragments of tissue 25x20x10 in aggregate. Two blocks, all submitted. RM
18/01/2018
MICROSCOPIC REPORT:
Several polyps and a small amount of non-polyp endometrium is seen. The polyps
comprisetwo benign endocervical mucosal polyps, several endometrial polyps and

polypoid mass which will be further described. The polypoid mass shows a marked
microglandular hyperplastic-like proliferation of glandular epithelium with a
lot of squamous metaplasia and numerous intraepithelial neutrophils.

The stroma is inflamed fibroblastic stroma and contains rare benign endometrial glands. In
a second polyp there is an area of close packed endometrioid glands showing
tubal metaplasia but no atypia. 2 other small polyps show mildly disordered
inactive endometrial glands without atypia. Abundant extracellular mucus and a
small amount of normal cervical squamous epitheliumare included. No normal
endocervical epithelium is included. No non-polyp endometrium seen
COMMENT
The polypoid mass with the microglandular hyperplastic like proliferation has a
differential diagnosis of FIGO grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma ( microglandular
hyperplastic variant)of the endometrium and benign microglandular hyperplasia
from the cervix. Endometrioid carcinoma is favoured supported by rare benign
endometrioid glands within the proliferation, the relatively large size of the
lesion and the presence of complex endometrial hyperplasia in another polyp.
DIAGNOSIS
Endometriums, polyps and curettings
- Polypoid mass with microglandular hyperplastic-like proliferation, favour
FIGO grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma (microglandular hyperplastic variant) of
the endometrium
- Multiple benign endocervical mucosal polyps and endometrial polyps, with
focal complex hyperplasia one of the endometrial polyps

CLINICAL HISTORY
TAH done for DUB.  Uterus and B/L Fallopian tubes.

MACROSCOPY
&amp;quot;Uterus and bilateral fallopian tubes&amp;quot; - Uterus with cervix and two
separate fallopian tubes in total 160g, 45mm intercornual width, 45mm
anterior to posterior and 90mm superior to inferior. The cervix without
ectocervix is 20 x 15mm and the cervical os is 18 x 5mm. The cervical
canal is patent 35mm and the endometrial cavity is 35mm long. The
myometrium is 25mm and the endometrium is 2mm thick. Separate fallopian
tube with fimbrial end is 5 x 6mm and other separate fallopian tube with
fimbrial end 37 x 6mm and inked blue. Note: no ectocervix identified.
RS, part processed. 7 blocks.
A-C - anterior uterus:
A - anterior cervix
B-1TS. C-1TS - composite anterior endo/myometrium.
D-1TS - posterior cervix
E-1TS - posterior fundus
F-5 pieces one fallopian tube
G-5 pieces blue inked fallopian tube. ap

MICROSCOPY
&amp;quot;Uterus and bilateral fallopian tubes&amp;quot; - The cervical transformation
zone mucosa is normal and there are no koilocytes or dysplasia. The
endocervical glandular mucosa is unremarkable and there is no
adenocarcinoma in situ. There is no ectocervical mucosa.
The endometrium is disordered proliferative with variable cystic
dilation of glands and scattered glands with irregular size and shape.
Plasma cells to indicate a chronic endometritis are not seen, and there
is no evidence of hyperplasia.
The myometrium is unremarkable.
The sections of fallopian tubes are normal. A benign paratubal cyst is
present. There is no atypia and no in situ change.
The ovaries are not present.
There is no evidence of malignancy.

SUMMARY DIAGNOSIS
UTERUS, CERVIX AND BILATERAL FALLOPIAN TUBES:
      -BENIGN TRANSFORMATION ZONE AND ENDOCERVICAL MUCOSA.
      -DISORDERED PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM
      -BENIGN MYOMETRIUM
      -BENIGN FALLOPIAN TUBES.
      -THERE IS NO ECTOCERVIX AND THERE ARE NO OVARIES.

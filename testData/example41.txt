HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
ACCESSION No. ZZ18-999920




CLINICAL HISTORY
Pap smear HSIL + invasion. Cervical biopsy - CIN 3.

MACROSCOPY
1. Cone biopsy, mark at 12 o&#39;clock: An orientated cone biopsy of
cervix  20 x 15mm in diameter x 15mm in depth. The ectocervical mucosa
is smooth  and congested. The cervical os is 7 x 3mm in diameter.
There is a suture midway along one  transverse margin indicating 12
o&#39;clock. 12 o&#39;clock margin inked green, 6 o&#39;clock margin inked black.
Block A: 1 transverse slice, 3 o&#39;clock margin. Blocks B, C: 1 serial
central transverse slice each, from 3 to 9 o&#39;clock. Block D : 1
transverse slice, 9 o&#39;clock margin.All tissue processed in 4 blocks.

2. Endometrial curettings: A small amount of soft red-brown tissue.
All processed.

MICROSCOPY
1. The serial sections show replacement of the surface epithelium by
atypical squamous cells with nuclear enlargement, hyperchromatism,
crowding and loss of cellular polarity associated with numerous
scattered bizarre mitotic figures. The surface epithelial
proliferation is associated with extensive replacement of endocervical
glands quite deeply into the cervical stroma. The deeper elements
retain the lobular configuration of the cervical glands and
unequivocal stromal invasion is not seen. In all sections an
ectocervical margin is recognised however, in the first plane of
section no endocervical margin is seen and the neoplastic change
extends through the inked surface. The glandular elements also show
irregular cystic dilatation.
2. The uterine curettings show tortuous dilated glands lined by
columnar eosinophilic epithelium and containing some secretion. The
spindle cell stroma is oedematous. There is no evidence of
inflammation or neoplasia.

CONCLUSION
1.  Cone biopsy of cervix: Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (CIN III)
with extensive endocervical glandular involvement.  This appears to
extend through the endocervical margin, at least focally.
2.  Uterine curettings: Secretory endometrium.

HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT
ACCESSION No. NULL18-000572

CLINICAL HISTORY
Menorrhagia. Prolapse. Histopath please - uterus/Cx/tubes.

MACROSCOPY
1. Bilateral fallopian tubes + fibroid + uterus + cervix: A uterus,
412 g and 145 x 89 x 80 mm (SI x transverse x AP), received with the
attached cervix coronally bisected, separate bilateral unoriented
fallopian tubes (designated fallopian tube one and fallopian tube two,
respectively), and a separate unoriented fragment of white fibrous
tissue. The ectocervix is approximately 40 x 25 mm (transverse x AP)
with a smooth tan white surface, however the os cannot be measured due
to received specimen sectioning. The endometrial cavity is 60 x 35 mm
(SI x transverse) with a haemorrhagic endometrial lining 1 mm thick.
The myometrium is 24 mm thick. There are 12 fibroids, 3 to 55 mm in
greatest dimension. The serosa is smooth tan, and includes a sub
serosal fibroid. The unoriented fragment of white fibrous tissue, 3.6
g, 31 x 17 x 17 mm. External surface is nodular white. Cut surface is
firm white.  Fallopian tube one is 49 x 8 mm with a fimbriated end,
and a para-tubular cyst, 13 mm in greatest dimension.  Fallopian tube
two is 58 x 7 mm with a fimbriated end.

1A: Anterior cervix
1B: Posterior cervix
1C: Anterior endometrium, myometrium and serosa, to include fibroid
1D: Posterior endometrium, myometrium and serosa to include fibroid
1E: Fibroid, TS of largest fibroid to include serosa
1F: unoriented fragment of white fibrous tissue
1G: Fallopian tube one
1H: Fallopian tube two

MICROSCOPY
Sections of the cervix show a thickened squamous epithelium with
hyperkeratosis consistent with prolapse. No evidence of dysplasia. The
endometrium is mid secretory in type with no evidence of hyperplasia.
The underlying myometrium shows scattered endometrial glands and
stroma indicating adenomyosis. The numerous fibroids are all confirmed
to be benign. Both fallopian tubes appear unremarkable.

CONCLUSION
Uterus and fallopian tubes - appearances consistent with uterine
prolapse. Cervix otherwise unremarkable.

Multiple benign fibroids.

Adenomyosis.

Mid secretory endometrium showing no evidence of hyperplasia.

Unremarkable fallopian tubes.

HISTORY
Ulcer - likely from pessary rub. F/U chart r/v 2/52 Histology bx cervix.
MACROSCOPIC
Russell McDonell, Cervix biopsy 12 o'clock: Four pieces of tissue, the larger two are white in colour, the smaller two are brown.  The white tissue measures 4x3x3 mm and 5x2x1 mm.  The smaller two brown pieces measure 2x2x1 mm and 1x1x1 mm.  1A blocked in toto.  (R McDonell/rm27)
MICROSCOPIC
The sections show fragments of stratified squamous epithelium, as well as separate fragments of ulcer base. One of the fragments of intact squamous epithelium shows active inflammation at one edge, with the remainder of this fragment and the other epithelial fragments being unremarkable. The fragments of ulcer base show acute and chronic inflammation and vascular congestion. A very small strip of squamous epithelium in this area shows reactive changes. No glandular epithelium or transformation zone sampling is present. There is no evidence of koilocytosis, dysplasia or malignancy.
SUMMARY
Cervix biopsy 12 o'clock: Ulcer.

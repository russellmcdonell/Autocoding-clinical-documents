Russell McDonell, LLETZ: An unorientated LLETZ biopsy of cervix measuring 16x14 mm to a depth of 10 mm.  The cervical os is slit-like and measures 7 mm in width.  The ectocervical mucosa is smooth and cream.  The endocervical margin is inked green, half of the stromal margin blue and the other half black.  The specimen is serially sectioned into six transverse slices and entirely submitted.  1A Shave one end ink side down; 1B-1E serial TS; 1F shave other end ink side down.  (Dr R McDonell/ram4)

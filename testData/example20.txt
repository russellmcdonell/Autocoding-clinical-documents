HISTOLOGY REPORT
----------------
SPECIMEN NUMBER: 2018A000207

SITE: CERVICAL BIOPSY.

CLINICAL NOTES:
Cervical biopsy.

MACROSCOPIC:
(Cx. Bx.).
The specimen consists of two greyish white biopsies, 4mm x 3mm x 2mm
and 4mm x 3mm x 2mm. All embedded in one block. (RM:rm)

MICROSCOPIC:
RCPA structured  reporting for  excisions and  colposcopic biopsies
for pre-invasive cervical neoplasia

Microscopic description:  Sections show two  cervical biopsies lined
by squamous and endocervical mucosa and underlying stroma containing
endocervical  glands. The squamous  epithelium shows  involvement by
high-grade squamous intra-epithelial  lesion (CIN 3) and HPV effect.
The CIN  3 focally   extends  down the   endocervical  glands.   The
keratinocytes are disorganised, the nuclei are markedly enlarged and
there is  marked  variation   nuclear size  and  shape. The  nuclear
membranes  are irregular  and the  chromatin  is granular.   Mitotic
figures are identified within the  epithelium.  There is no invasive
malignancy.   There is  no glandular  atypia.  There is  patchy mild
chronic cervicitis present.

Tissues present:  Ectocervical,  endocervical mucosa  and underlying
stroma.

SCJ included in specimen: Present.

High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Present.
      HSIL subtype: CIN 3.
      Extent: Focal.

AIS: Not seen.

Stratified Mucin-producing Intraepithelial Lesion (SMILE): Not seen.

Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion: Present.

Margins for pre-invasive disease N/A.

Other pathology: Mild patchy chronic cervicitis.

Ancillary studies
      HR HPV: other detected.
      P16: Not performed.

DIAGNOSIS:
Cervical biopsy: HIGH-GRADE SQUAMOUS  INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION (CIN 3)
AND HPV EFFECT. No invasive malignancy. (RM:ram)

CLINICAL HISTORY
Uterine fibroid.  Uterus, cervix, fibroid and fallopian tubes.

MACROSCOPY
Labelled uterus/fibroid, fallopian tubes: the specimen consists of a
uterus with attached pedunculated nodule weighing a total of 454g.  The
uterus is 105mm from fundus to cervix, 55mm in the intercornual
dimension and 48mm anterior to posterior. The serosal surface is smooth
and intact.  Attached to the left posterior fundus is a large smooth
nodule 85x63x78mm.  The cut surface through this nodule has a cream/tan
whorled appearance.

The cervix is 18mm.  The endometrium is 1mm in thickness and the
myometrium is up to 23mm in thickness.

There are two separately submitted fallopian tubes, the first is 52x8mm.
The second is 41x7mm.

BLOCK NOTATION:
A = anterior cervix
B = posterior cervix
C = anterior myometrium
D = posterior endomyometrium
E = anterior endometrium, posterior endomyometrium
F,G = section between the uterus and pedunculated fibroid
H to K = representative fibroid
L = LS,TS of first fallopian tube
M = LS, TS of second fallopian tube  P13. (RM/rm)

MICROSCOPY
Sections through the cervix show normal ectocervical and endocervical
epithelium. There is no dysplasia or malignancy within the
transformation zone. Several inclusions cysts are present.
Sections of the uterus show proliferative phase endometrium. The
endometrial glands are tubular and slightly elongated and irregular.
Mitoses are present.  There is no atypical hyperplasia or malignancy.
The underlying myometrium is within normal limits.

Sections through the pedunculated leiomyoma show bundles and fascicles
of smooth muscle. There is no increase in the cellularity. There is no
atypia or mitoses.  In some areas the leiomyoma appears oedematous. No
coagulative necrosis is seen.

Sections through the first fallopian tubes show the fimbrial end and the
plicae to be lined by ciliated and non-ciliated epithelium. There is no
dysplasia or malignancy.
The sections through the second fallopian tube show similar features. A
small paratubal cyst is seen.   There is no dysplasia or malignancy.

CONCLUSION

HYSTERECTOMY AND BILATERAL SALPINGECTOMY:
-     PROLIFERATIVE PHASE ENDOMETRIUM.
-     BENIGN LEIOMYOMA.
-     INCLUSION CYSTS WITHIN THE CERVIX.
-     NORMAL FALLOPIAN TUBES.
-     THERE IS NO DYSPLASIA OR MALIGNANCY.

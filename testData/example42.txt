HISTOPATHOLOGY

REF: 2018/1431

CLINICAL HISTORY
Vaginal hysterectomy B/L salpingectomy, right oophorectomy.
1. Uterus.
2. Left tube (fallopian).
3. Right ovary + tube.

MACROSCOPY
Labelled uterus, cervix, left fallopian tube, right ovary + tube: the
specimen consists of a uterus, cervix and attached left fallopian tube,
weighing 74g, 75mm from fundus to cervix, 43mm in the intercornual
dimension and 38mm anterior to posterior dimension. The serosal surface
is smooth and intact. The cervix is 30mm in diameter, with a centrally
placed os. There is an anterior vaginal cuff, 10mm in width, posterior
vaginal cuff, 11mm in width.
The endometrium is &amp;lt;1mm in thickness, the myometrium is 17mm. Within the
anterior uterus there is an intramural leiomyoma, 7mm across.
The left fallopian tube is 58mm in length, 5mm in diameter.
There is a separate right ovary with attached fallopian tube. The ovary
is 25x16x8mm. The fallopian tube is 56x5mm.

BLOCK NOTATION:
A = anterior cervix.
B = posterior cervix.
C = anterior endomyometrium.
D = posterior endomyometrium.
E = LS left fallopian tube.
F = TS left fallopian tube.
G = TS right ovary.
H = LS right fallopian tube.
I = TS right fallopian tube. P9. (RM/rm)

MICROSCOPY
The sections from the cervix show no features of dysplasia or
significant change.
Patchy chronic inflammation is also noted. The endometrium shows
inactive endometrial glands surrounded by inactive stroma. A few
cystically dilated glands are also noted within the endometrium. The
myometrium is within normal limits.
The fallopian tubes show thickened plicae lined by epithelium showing no
features of epithelial atypia.
There is very marked crush artefact within the fallopian tube stroma in
the **** ovary.
Many cystically dilated spaces seen show paratubal cysts and some benign
inclusion cysts.
The ovary sampled in Block 1G shows changes of degenerative ovary. There
are no features of epithelial lined cyst seen in this ovary. (rm)

CONCLUSION

HYSTERECTOMY, LEFT SALPINGECTOMY AND RIGHT SALPINGO-OOPHORECTOMY -
INACTIVE/ATROPHIC ENDOMETRIUM.

MYOMETRIUM WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.

CERVIX WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.

RIGHT FALLOPIAN TUBE AND OVARY WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.

LEFT FALLOPIAN TUBE WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS.

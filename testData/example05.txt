    HISTOPATHOLOGY REPORT:   Accession 170024008
    
    CLINICAL NOTES:
    Right ovarian cyst. Endometrial curettings. Right ovarian cyst.
    MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    (A) Endometrial curettings : Multiple fragments  of  pale  tan  and  haemorrhagic
    tissue in aggregate measuring 50 x 30 x 5mm. All in. 2 blocks.
    (B) Right ovarian cyst : Five irregular  ragged  fragments  of  pale  tan  tissue
    consisting froma possible collapsed cyst, measuring 5 x 4 x 3mm to  16  x  12  x
    2mm. The largest piece has additional fluid filled firm  cystic  adhesions,  3mm
    and 4mm in maximum dimension. The collapsed cyst wall is  shiny  with  areas  of
    focal haemorrhage. The wall measures  up  to  1mm  in  thickness.  The  internal
    surface is roughened and has a small area of corpus luteum. The larger piece  is
    serially sliced into five transverse sections. All in. B1-B2. B1: larger piece.
    B2: remaining tissue. RM/RM2 23.11.17
    MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION:
    (A) Sections show fragments of proliferative phase endometrium.  The glands  are
    small tubular and show no increased in glands to  stroma  ratio.   There  is  no
    hyperplasia or neoplasia.
    (B) Sections show fragments of ovarian cyst wall  in  which  there  are  thyroid
    follicles seen some containing colloid.  There are no adnexal  structures,  skin
    or glial elements present.
    No immature elements or malignant transformation  is  seen.  RM/RM2.   24/11/17.
    
    DIAGNOSIS:
    (A) ENDOMETRIAL CURETTINGS:  PROLIFERATIVE ENDOMETRIUM.
    (B) RIGHT OVARIAN CYST  :  STRUMA OVARII,   NO MALIGNANCY.
    SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT TTF-1 TO FOLLOW.
    Reported by : Dr Russell McDonell.
    SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT.
    IHC TTF-1 confirmed   there  is  strong  nuclear  staining  within  the  thyroid
    follicles in the ovarian  cyst  hence  consistent  with  struma  ovarii.   Final
    diagnosis remain unchanged.

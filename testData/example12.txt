Clinical  Notes:  HPV  other  type  (non-16/18).  LBL  -  LSIL.  No endocervical
component. Histopathology. LEEP - stitch at 12 o'clock.
Previous biopsies: None.
MACROSCOPIC FINDINGS:
Pot  labelled:  'LEEP stitch   12 o'clock'. An excision of cervix 14 mm right to
left  by  14  mm  anterior  to  posterior by 12 mm in length, with a smooth pale
ectocervix with small scattered pinpoint haemorrhages. The cores is not patient.
Specimen  is oriented with a suture at 12:00, with 3?12?9:00 inked blue 9?6?3:00
inked black.
A - 3 o'clock margin, B-E - sections 3 to 9 o'clock, F - 9 o'clock section. A6.
SRT.
MICROSCOPIC FINDINGS:
All  of  the  tissue  has  been embedded in serial sections.  A minimum of three
levels have been examined from each block.
Sections   show   reactive  and  regenerative  changes  in  squamous  epithelium
surrounding the external os. In several areas, features suggest HPV infection,
however  definite  dysplasia  is not seen. Unfortunately, much of the epithelium
covering  the  posterior  lip  has been denuded. A moderate chronic inflammatory
infiltrate  is  present  within  the  underlying  stroma.  The epithelium of the
endocervical  canal  appears unremarkable. No evidence of glandular neoplasia is
seen.
DIAGNOSIS:

 LEEP cone biopsy                    Reactive and regenerative changes in
 of cervix.                          squamous epithelium around the external
                                     os.
                                     Features suggest HPV infection but
                                     definite dysplasia is not seen.
                                     Moderate chronic cervicitis.
